# The gatsby master class

## What will you need 

NodeJs https://nodejs.org/en/ , install either the stable release of node or the current release.

You'll need to have at least node version eight point eleven.

Good code editor and I would highly recommend Visual Studio Code.

Our Gatsby sites will be using a service called Netify  https://www.netlify.com/

ContentFull, and you can sign up with them once again contentful.com.

And finally, for our user purchases and for creating our shopping cart within our application, we'll be using a service called snipcart and you can sign up there at snipcart.com 

Wiht NodeJs installed, you'll be given a package manager that comes with nodecalled NPM to install all of our Gadsty packages.

So once you have NPM, you can head to your terminal or command line.

And once you've got that open, you'll need to install a tool that will allow us to create new Gadsby projects and that's called The Gatsby CLI, this particular NPM package is one that will need to have installed globally on our computer  so we can access it anywhere.

And in order to install it, we'll need to run the command 

```shell 
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

And we'll need to add to the beginning of this command sudo in order to run it as a super user.

## Plugins and Starters

https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/

Plugins are fundamentally packages that allow us to extend the functionality of our Gatsby projects. They allow us to do additional stuff.

And then starters are Gatsby projects that have already been reconfigured with these Gatsby plugins. So if you want to make a gasp project quickly, you don't want to have to install a set of tools manually.

## check the version

gatsby -v
```
Gatsby CLI version: 4.0.0
